                    <b>Bachelors of Science in Information Technology</b>
                    <br/>
                    <b>2nd year</b>
                    <p>As a passionate second-year Information Technology student at University of Hertfordshire, I am driven by a keen interest in emerging technologies and their potential to transform businesses and solve complex problems. </p>
                    <p>My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in programming languages like Python and Java, network infrastructure, and cybersecurity principles. I am particularly fascinated by cloud computing and artificial intelligence, and have completed several projects demonstrating my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios, such as developing a web application for local small businesses and participating in a cybersecurity hackathon. </p>
                    <p>Beyond academics, I am an active member of the university's IT Club, where I collaborate with peers on innovative tech projects and stay updated on the latest industry trends. My goal is to leverage my technical skills and creative problem-solving abilities to contribute meaningfully to the rapidly evolving world of information technology.</p>
